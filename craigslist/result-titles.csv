 New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure, is seeking a resourceful, skilled project architect with 5-10 years’ relevant experience to join us in executing a growing slate of challenging projects.  
 
We’re proud to be an industry leader in crucial practice areas like facade inspections and repairs (Local Law 11), roof repairs, and investigation and remediation of structural issues. We've won numerous awards—including ten Lucy Moses preservation awards—as well as the loyalty of many of the premier public, corporate, and residential clients in the region.  

Absolutely. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer applications that integrate construction drawings, specifications, cost estimating, scheduling, and construction administration; advanced photography and image processing; and state-of-the-art, non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques. In fact, we have an in-house studio dedicated to such supporting technology, constantly developing new digital tools (think James Bond’s “Q”).    .

 
Honestly, we offer aspects of both. You’ll work as part of a small team assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This gives you the dual advantages of a small office experience coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm.  

You’ll participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see your designs executed in the field and you'll take on greater responsibility and client management as soon as you are ready. 

An array of building types, including courthouses, schools, universities, churches, and hospitals, and many of New York's most storied landmarks.  
 
We embrace all components of the building envelope and underlying structure—facades, roofs, windows, and plazas—and the full complement of materials, from historic terra-cotta to high-performance curtain walls.  


We offer an array of benefits and growth opportunities:





Our light-filled Tribeca office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and stunning views of Manhattan in three directions—not a bad place to spend the work day. We’re easily accessible via public transportation: the A, C, and E Canal Street station connects directly to our building’s lobby. The N, R, 1, and 6 lines are all just a few blocks away.



Send us your resume, a cover letter with salary requirements, and a few pages of attachments (maximum of 10MB, please) or a link to your portfolio that demonstrates your experience and capabilities. We look forward to meeting you! 

Please note that, due to the high number of applicants, we can only contact candidates under consideration.
